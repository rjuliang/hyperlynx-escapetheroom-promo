          <h1>Your Mission</h1>
          <p> You are a normal kid from a small little town in the heart of Illinois. Just like any other place there is that creepy old man who lives in the old mansion on the hill. No one knows much about him. There are two things that people know for sure. He takes his dog on a walk every day for thirty minutes and every morning he can be seen watching the sunrise with a mysterious box. No one knows what is in the box. So it is up to you and your friends to find out. You and your friends must find a way into his home, solve a few mysteries, and make it out with the box before he returns. Can you do it?</p>
